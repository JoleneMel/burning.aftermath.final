        <h1> Welcome to Burning Aftermath</h1>,
        <p> Within Burning Aftermath was a world created by my friends that was used as our own table top role playing game. There is a 
            lot of homelore, a sort of sandbox of imagnation that we could build upon with all our sessions. There is even a spinoff version 
            of this in the far far future called Burning Cold, which may be implemented in the future as a different option to play with. 

            Utilizing this old rule set I wanted to make part of my project come to life, that being creating player characters that would be able 
            to be seen on a seperate view. Utilizing react-bootstarps Card they reminded me of the micro index card sized player sheets one of our
            friends made and played with. 

            This is a small sample of the amount I have had planned with this project, I want to do a lot more with it, in the furture I have plans 
            for there to be two sides of view, player view and game master view. The players side could be done in an engaging way that would help 
            players stay engaged while still being useful. With the recent pandemic we have all been playing our table top game over the internet. 
            Which hasnt been very helpful in capivating my full attention completely. 

            I kept thinking of ways this could be imporved for both sides, the player and the gm. The gm could have this sandbox to play with, have 
            their own lore being just a click away. Map out dungeons with placed enimeies, traps, treasures, scipted moments for important encounters. 
            Create their own kingdom with important NPCs(non-playable characters), shops that sell specific items, surprise encounters, or general 
            notes. They could build a kingdom from more then their notes and utilize the sandbox of art they have access to. Including a soon to added 
            character creation. So their npcs arent limited by their capabilites in art, there can also be some defaults to help take the burden of 
            being a new gm and how scary it could be to keep a parties attention. 

            For the players there could be more capivating view, a created character with their health, power, and any other affect easy seen. Hovering 
            over a spell could show the range, same with ranged weapons, movement speed, taking into account any bonuses the player may have too. Like
            a sneak attack, a support spell from another party member, or helping with adding up the attack hit total. 

            Getting into table top gaming can be a little intimidating with all the rules just to create a character. I wanted this to feel more like 
            a video game version of a table top game that gives the gm control to create their campaign sandbox. The character creation could help with 
            displaying their mini character around town, or in the battle feild. There could be clickable places within the kingdoms map that could lead
            to an inn or a merchant's store. 

            The possibilites while exciting could also get some players to feel overwhelmed, so there would be preset adventures and stories that can 
            be played with the party to try out the service. Or even play without a gm, but that would be a very limited set of adventures due to a 
            parties ability to be very unpredictable. But this service would have some defaults that would ease the gms workload or they could carefully
            craft their own kingdom right down the layout and npcs. 

            This would also help with ease of XP being automatically added, players being able to easily level their characters, magic items being added 
            into account when in battle or in story moments. This is a very large project that cannot simply be done within 2 weeks but what has been 
            done was rule books, item shop, a working navbar, a very very basic character creation process. A sneak peak into the future of this project 
            which I hope to continue working on after graduation.
